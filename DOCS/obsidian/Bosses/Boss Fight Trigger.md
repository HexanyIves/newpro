*Starts boss battle*

The Boss fight sequence starts when hero overlaps boss fight trigger.
Overlapping with this trigger causes the following:
- Boss doors close: boss doors are ad-hoc [[Switches and Doors|doors]] with different art that close when boss battle starts and only open again when the boss is defeated;
- Boss Music plays: Boss music starts instantly and will play until the boss is defeated. After that, the game will remain without music -- or use a post-boss ambience loop -- until hero overlaps a [[Music-Trigger|music-trigger]].
