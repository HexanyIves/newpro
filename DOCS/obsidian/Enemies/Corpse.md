- All dead enemies that were spawned naturally -- i.e., enemies that were not spawned via [[Enemy Spawner|enemy spawners]] are forever drawn as corpses. This helps players to know the places they've already been to, by looking at their victims laying on the floor;
- Volatile corpse: [[Enemies]] that were spawned with enemy spawners, on the other hand, have their corpses flushed when out of the screen, *or* when the amount of corpses on screen is bigger than a certain value.
