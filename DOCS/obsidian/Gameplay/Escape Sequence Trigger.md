- Overlapping a Escape Sequence Trigger will cause the game to enter Escape sequence mode;
- During Escape Sequence Mode, a reverse timer is displayed on screen;
- When the timer reaches zero, the hero dies, and has to repeat the sequence;
- There are no CHECKPOINTS after the Escape Sequence, so don't even worry with it!
