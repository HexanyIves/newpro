- The input sequence parser look for button press sequences at every new input. When a valid sequence is found, it generates an event. E.g., Pressing UP on the d-pad four times in a row can cause the game to pause;
- Along with the buttons pressed, the times between each input is also taken into account when verifying the sequence;
- Entering all the available sequences must be easy to perform, edit and test, as the game can have a big volume of codes;
- All ongoing inputs logged on the input sequence parser should be purged when hero dies.
