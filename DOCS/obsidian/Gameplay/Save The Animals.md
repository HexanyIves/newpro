*pays homage to Super Metroid's iconic "secret ending"*

- A room with npcs called animals;
- Animals are objects similar to [[Collectibles|collectibles]]. As such, they have two states and everything;
- The main difference is that saving the Animals will not increase collectible count;
- Saving the Animals begets a slightly different ending as well.
