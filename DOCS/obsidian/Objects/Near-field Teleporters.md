- Upon being shot by hero, transports (see below) hero to the exact location where NFT was hit by pellet;
- Also works with enemies that are able to shoot. In this case, the enemy is the one teleported;
- NFTs will not operate before the NFT system is unlocked by the hero (i.e, the NFT powerup is acquired).

Transportation tweening:
- Transported object (hero or enemy) will move at constant speed (FAST!!), in a straight line, with all its colliders and triggers NOT FUNCTIONING during transport. The sole reason for this is to make it easier for players to orientate themselves during transport. Transport speed in tunable.
