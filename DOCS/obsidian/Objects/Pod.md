*A pod is a vehicle the hero can enter and use*

- Pod is entered when the hero overlaps with it;
- Although the control scheme is the same as hero's, the pod has completely different physics and shooting abilities;
- Pods fire incendiary shots in repetition, like a machine gun;
- Pods can shoot in all three directions supplied by the control scheme (front, back and up);
- Pod is not affected by gravity;
- Pods can't get past water (collide);
- Pods cannot use NFT;
- Camera Scale (magnification) is different when hero is inside pod;
- To leave a pod, the pod needs to be taken to a POD DOCK. Overlapping a pod and a POD DOCK will cause the hero to be spawned next to the pod.
