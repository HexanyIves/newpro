General thoughts regarding implementation
- OPTIONS MENU: language arrows will only appear when [[Multi-Language Support|LANGUAGE]] is selected;
- SELECT SLOT: the "Y to erase save" button hint will only appear -- and work -- if focus is currently over a [[Save System|save file]] that is NOT EMPTY;
- SLOT X ERASED: this popup is closed by pushing either A, B or START (XBOX LAYOUT). The input is only monitored 0.5 second after popup is shown;
- B-button will provide BACK funcionality in every screen or state that bears a BACK option;
- B-button will resume paused games;
- B-button will cancel "ERASE GAME" popup;
- ESC key will do EVERYTHING the B-button does, PLUS pause the game.
