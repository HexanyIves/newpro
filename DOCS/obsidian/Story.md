Inside take on her cockpit

CONTRACTOR (on radio): Again, it's quite straightforward: go in, kill everything, go home. And by God don't break anything. If blowing up the complex was even remotely an option, a couple missiles would cost a tenth of what we're paying you.
- (1) HERO: Why is this laboratory so important anyway?
	- CONTRACTOR: If I tell you, I'll have to kill you. And please, don't find that out.
	- HERO: Nevermind.
- (2) HERO: What am I killing there, exactly?
	- CONTRACTOR: Your specialty: aliens, mutants, robots, monsters, ghosts and the undead.
- (3) HERO: Yeah, I heard the first time.



CONTRACTOR: Alright, this is where we part ways. Radio reception is terrible in there. If you ever stumble upon a working comm station, don't hesitate to call me.
